# Reinforcement Learning
Classes of traditional and deep reinforment learning agents designed to train on openAI environments. 

I have finished writing traditional learners to handle discrete action and state spaces (OpenAI Toy Text), and discrete action space with
a continuous state space (OpenAI Classic Control). 

I plan to use this project for my Senior Thesis Project in Computer Science.
